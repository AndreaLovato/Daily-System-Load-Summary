# Daily System Load Summary Dashboard  
*Delivering Executive Visibility into System Performance by Rate and Revenue Class*

## Project Background  
To support strategic oversight and financial planning, leadership required a consistent, high-level view of system performance by rate and revenue class. I created and maintained a daily dashboard—delivered with a one-day lag—that provided executives with insight into usage trends, load composition, operational discrepancies, and financial impacts.

## Tools Used  
- **Excel** – Data modeling, formatting, and delivery  
- **Power BI** – Visualizations and interactive exploration  
- **MDM Portal** – Source of interval system data  
- **Wholesale Supplier Portal** – Power purchase and meter data  
- **SCADA and Leidos Systems** – Distribution-level readings and validation inputs  
- **NOAA API** – Daily temperatures, heating and cooling degree days

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Load analysis by rate and revenue class  
- Multi-period trend analysis (YoY, MoM, MTD)  
- Data validation across SCADA, wholesale supply, and third-party (Leidos) systems  
- Executive-level dashboard design and delivery  
- KPI tracking, weather normalization, and system loss estimation  
- Cross-functional collaboration across finance, engineering, and operations  
- Communication of system performance to board and regulators

## Summary  
I developed a daily system summary dashboard that visualized total load by rate and revenue class, paired with daily, month-to-date, and year-over-year usage trends. The dashboard integrated weather context (heating and cooling degree days, temperature), compared SCADA readings to wholesale supplier and Leidos data to estimate system line loss, and helped identify when SCADA measurements were inconsistent or required adjustment.

This dashboard was most heavily used by the CFO for financial tracking but was referenced broadly across the organization—including by engineering and operations—to monitor system reliability, consumption anomalies, and load composition by class. I also presented key insights from the dashboard to the board of directors and regulatory body to communicate system performance and justify data-informed strategy.

## Key Takeaways  
- Delivered automated daily reporting of system load and trends by rate and revenue class  
- Identified operational discrepancies by comparing SCADA, wholesale, and Leidos data  
- Provided leadership, board, and regulators with consistent insights into system usage, efficiency, and performance drivers
